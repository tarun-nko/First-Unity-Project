# First-Unity-Project
Its a 3D game in development. 

The core idea of the game is for the player to predict the top view of a 3D figure, when only the side view is available.

The way he/she will predict is by carving out the the top view from a disk.
If he/she has carved the disk correctly, the disk will perfectly fit the 3D figure. 

Core functionality is currently being developed.
